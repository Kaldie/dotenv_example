Ever wanted to know how you would load your secret variable into your python project.
Look no further, an example is given here.

Inside the build.sh is a command to build your image, as you can see the build command includes some build args, these are inserted into the containers as env vars
These can be used to superseed the variable defined in a .env file. Without the build arguments the values in the env file will be used.

TL;DR: ensure your build pipeline runs the command as described in build.sh replacing the values for what you want
